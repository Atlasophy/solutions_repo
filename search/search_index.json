The relationship between range and angle is non-linear and highly sensitive to parameters like initial speed and gravity . By analyzing this systematically, we reveal how small changes in conditions lead to drastically different outcomes \u2014 useful in sports, engineering, and military contexts. \ud83d\udcd0 Theoretical Foundation From Newton\u2019s Second Law , the motion of a projectile (ignoring air resistance) is described by: Horizontal motion: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t $$ Vertical motion: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ \u23f1 Time of Flight (T) Assuming the projectile lands at the same height it was launched: \\[ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\cdot \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] \ud83d\udccf Range (R) Substitute \\( T \\) into the horizontal position equation: \\[ R = v_0 \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot T = \\frac{v_0^2 \\cdot \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] \ud83d\udcca Analysis of the Range For a fixed \\( v_0 \\) and \\( g \\) , the range is symmetric around \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . Increasing initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) quadratically increases the range.
