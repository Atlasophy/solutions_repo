# Mechanics – Problem 1

## Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

---

###  Motivation

Projectile motion demonstrates key physical principles through accessible equations. The relationship between range and angle is **non-linear** and highly **sensitive** to parameters like **initial speed** and **gravity**. By analyzing this systematically, we reveal how small changes in conditions lead to drastically different outcomes — useful in sports, engineering, and military contexts.

---

###  Theoretical Foundation

From **Newton’s Second Law**, the motion of a projectile (ignoring air resistance) is described by:

- **Horizontal motion:**

  $$
  x(t) = v_0 \cdot \cos(\theta) \cdot t
  $$

- **Vertical motion:**

  $$
  y(t) = v_0 \cdot \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
  $$

---

### ⏱ Time of Flight (T)

Assuming the projectile lands at the same height it was launched:

$$
T = \frac{2 v_0 \cdot \sin(\theta)}{g}
$$

---

###  Range (R)

Substitute \( T \) into the horizontal position equation:

$$
R = v_0 \cdot \cos(\theta) \cdot T = \frac{v_0^2 \cdot \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$

---

###  Analysis of the Range

- For a fixed \( v_0 \) and \( g \), the range is **symmetric** around \( \theta = 45^\circ \).
- Increasing initial velocity \( v_0 \) **quadratically increases** the range.
- Higher gravitational acceleration \( g \) **reduces** the range.

---

###  Practical Applications

- **Sports**: Optimizing throw angles in javelin, football, or basketball.
- **Military**: Calculating artillery or missile trajectories.
- **Engineering**: Drone launches, rocket design, ballistic modeling.

---

###  Limitations and Extensions

- **Air Resistance**: Reduces range and shifts the optimal angle **below 45°**.
- **Uneven Terrain**: Requires solving with a **non-zero final height**.
- **Wind Effects**: Add lateral and vertical components that require solving **differential equations**.

---

###  3D Simulation and Visualization

- The range can be visualized as a function of the launch angle \( \theta \) using simulations.
- 2D plots with `matplotlib` or 3D simulations using `plotly` or `vpython` can illustrate this.
- Example plots: **Range vs. Angle** for different initial speeds.
