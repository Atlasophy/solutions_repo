Problem 1: Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

Objective:

Analyze how the horizontal range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection, considering various initial conditions.

Tasks:
	1.	Theoretical Foundation:
	•	Derive the equations of motion for projectile motion without air resistance.
	•	Express the horizontal range R as a function of the launch angle \theta, initial speed v_0, and gravitational acceleration g.
	2.	Analysis of the Range:
	•	Determine the angle \theta that yields the maximum range.
	•	Explore how variations in v_0 and g affect the range.
	3.	Practical Applications:
	•	Discuss real-world scenarios where projectile motion is applicable.
	•	Consider factors like uneven terrain or air resistance and how they modify the idealized model.
	4.	Implementation:
	•	Develop a Python script to simulate projectile motion.
	•	Generate plots showing the range as a function of the launch angle for different initial speeds.

Deliverables:
	•	A Markdown document (README.md) containing:
	•	Theoretical derivations.
	•	Explanations of the simulation results.
	•	Discussions on practical applications and model limitations.
	•	A Python script (projectile_motion.py) that:
	•	Calculates the range for various launch angles.
	•	Plots range vs. angle graphs.
	•	Visualizations (e.g., PNG images) of the plots generated.
